# vae-gan-code-for-reinforced-panel
My first work in academic career, you can treat it as a vae library, with many variations of vae including vae-gan.

If you want to use and modify the code in this library to implement your own vae-gan, 
you can just focus on vae_gan_pure_16_20211202.py.  

PS:

input: 128x128x3 in tfrecord format.
